# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# OS X Finder
.DS_Store

# Xcode per-user config
*.mode1
*.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
*.perspective
*.perspectivev3
*.pbxuser
*.xcworkspace
xcuserdata

# Build products
build/
*.o
*.LinkFileList
*.hmap

# Automatic backup files
